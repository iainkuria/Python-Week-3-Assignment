## 📌 Instructions

1. Create a function named `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` that:
   - Takes the original price (`price`) and discount percentage (`discount_percent`) as parameters.
   - If the discount is **20% or higher**, applies the discount and returns the final price.
   - Otherwise, returns the **original price**.

2. Using the `calculate_discount` function:
   - Prompt the user to enter the **original price** of an item.
   - Prompt the user to enter the **discount percentage**.
   - Print the **final price** after applying the discount, or if no discount was applied, print the original price.

## 💻 Example Output

```text
Enter the original price: 1000
Enter the discount percentage: 25
Final price after discount: 750.0
